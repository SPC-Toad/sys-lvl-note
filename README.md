# Low level system notes!
- These are notes that I have taken since the start of my low level system journey!
## Scheduling.md
- This will talk about `queuing theory` to basic `scheduling policies` and `synchronization`

## OS.md
- This will talk about the VERY basics of `Operating System`. 
- I avoided the overlap of same materials covered in scheduling.md

## If you see any mistakes or errors, please let me know!
