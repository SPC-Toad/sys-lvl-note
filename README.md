# Low level system notes!
- These are notes that I have taken since the start of my low level system journey!

## general-knowledge.md
- This will be just mesh of all the general knowledge that I picked up.
- These include the questions that I had during my computer journey (mostly with answers)

## Scheduling.md
- This will talk about `queuing theory` to basic `scheduling policies` and `synchronization`

## OS.md
- This will talk about the VERY basics of `Operating System`. 
- I will try to avoid having overlap of the same materials covered in scheduling.md, but as you know you need to know both LOL

## If you see any mistakes or errors, please let me know!
